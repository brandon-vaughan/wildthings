Web Tech Presentation - "Where the Wild Things Are: Using CSS3 in the Wild with jQuery"

This is a little presentation I did at the Web Tech event we had @nclud.

Basic takeaways are:

1. Let's change corse from jQuery first with CSS3 to support to CSS3 first with jQuery support. If we build our events and effect in CSS3 first we can use jQuery to inject classes allowing our CSS to take over from there and for those without they still benefit from a symantic insight into what types of animations are happening for each element.

2. Using state/event-based classes to define actions of elements and events. This helps to conceptualize what ux effect we are developing and help future-proof code as CSS3 support increases.
